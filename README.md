# To-Do-app
To-Do App This is a simple To-Do application built with Flet, a Python framework for building interactive web, mobile, and desktop apps. The app allows users to add tasks, view them in a list, and keep track of what's completed. Tasks are saved using Python's pickle module, ensuring that your task list is persistent between sessions.
